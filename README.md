# Emergent Ventures Embeddings-Based Search

Emergent Ventures (https://www.mercatus.org/emergent-ventures) is a grant program run by Mercatus. This repo has a CSV of EV winners (until April 2022) and a Python file that generates embeddings for each of their projects and has a simple search function. 

Usage is just "python3 search_winners.py query number-of-results". number-of-results is optional and defaults to 10.
